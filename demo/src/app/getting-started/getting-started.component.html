  <h3>
    Dependencies
  </h3>
  <p>
    This repository contains a Angular v6+ Bootstrap-styled Toggle that can be used as a standalone toggle or can convert checkboxes into UI toggles.
    As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript is required. The only required dependencies are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a> (<em>requires</em> Angular version 6 or higher, tested with 6.1.10)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap CSS</a> (<em>requires</em> Bootstrap 4.0 or higher, tested with 4.1.3)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    Supported browsers
  </h3>
  <p>We strive to support the same browsers and versions as supported by both Bootstrap 4 and Angular, whichever is more restrictive. Check browser support notes for
    <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/browser-support.html" target="_blank">Angular</a> and
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Our code is automatically tested on all the supported browsers.</p>

  <h3>
    Installation
  </h3>
  <p>After installing the above dependencies, install <code>ngx-toggle</code> via: <br><code>npm install --save ngx-toggle</code></p>

  <p>Once installed you need to import our main module.</p>
  <pre>import &#123;NgxToggleModule} from 'ngx-toggle';</pre>
  <p>
    The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application modules that make use of the components in this library:
  </p>
  <pre>import &#123;NgxToggleModule} from 'ngx-toggle';

@NgModule(&#123;
  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],
  imports: [NgxToggleModule, ...],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule &#123;
}</pre>

  <h4>
    SystemJS
  </h4>
  <p>
    If you are using SystemJS, you should also adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your systemjs config file, <code>map</code> needs to tell the System loader where to look for <code>ngx-toggle</code>:
  </p>
  <pre><code>map: &#123;
  'ngx-toggle': 'node_modules/ngx-toggle/bundles/ngx-toggle.js',
}</code></pre>
  <h3>
    Getting Help
  </h3>
  <p>
    Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports
    and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ngx-toggle" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> where the community at large are looking
    at questions tagged with <code>ngx-toggle</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    StackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>there are hundreds of people willing to help on StackOverflow,</li>
    <li>questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else, and</li>
    <li>the SO voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.
